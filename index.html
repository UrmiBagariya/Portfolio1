            <h3>Hello, I'm Urmi Bagariya, an aspiring web developer specializing in Front-End development. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,  and hands-on experience with frameworks and librariesMy journey into coding began when I was in the first sem of college.And luckily I was selected as GCF student.In starting it seemed boring as by that time we are leaning syntax,so yeah it seems quite boring.But as soon as I learned the syntax and basic programming ,it became my interest I'm passionate about building clean, efficient code and creating user-friendly digital experiences.
